# Introduction to Data Visualization in R with `ggplot2`

Data visualization stands as a cornerstone in the data analysis cycle, permeating its beginning, middle, and end stages.

In this module, emphasis lies on practical, hands-on code sessions over theoretical discussions, fostering an interactive learning experience.

We will delve into the visualization capabilities of the ggplot2 library within the tidyverse ecosystem, a versatile tool favored by renowned entities such as the [BBC](https://bbc.github.io/rcookbook/) and the [Financial Times](https://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2018/06/ft-bbc-uses-r.html).

Let's proceed by installing and loading the ggplot2 library.

```{r ggplot01}

library(ggplot2)

```

We're going to use datasets provided by the ggplot2 library as examples. Let's start with `mpg`.

```{r ggplot02}

mpg

```


Similar to how language grammar organizes language using a set of rules, the grammar of graphics delineates a set of rules for structuring graphs.

At its core, the **grammar of graphics** revolves around the concept of layers. A coherent combination of layers culminates in the formation of a graph

## Layers

* _Data_: source dataset being visualized
* _Aesthetics_: links variables in the dataset to visual properties like color, size, and shape
* _Geometries_: visual representation used for the data (line, points, bars)
* _Facets_: divides the data into subsets based on one or more categorical variables (country, gender, age)
* _Statistics_: computed geometries based on statistical measures
* _Coordinates_: specifies the type of coordinate system, such as cartesian, polar, etc.
* _Themes_: appearance of plot decorations (axis, grid lines, background)

Fundamentally, every plot necessitates a dataset, a geometric representation, and aesthetic specifications.


```{r ggplot03}
#| eval: false

ggplot(data = <DATA>, mapping = aes(<MAP>)) + <GEOMETRY>(OPTIONS)

```

The Geometry refers to the type of plot (scatter, line, bar, etc.), and aesthetics describe how we map data onto the axes, essentially what we place on the axes.

The function for creating a plot is `ggplot()`.

Let's construct a plot that relates the variables `displ` and `hwy`. The first step is to call the data and specify the variables we want to represent; this latter aspect is what ggplot refers to as *aesthetics*

## Data and aesthetics

```{r ggplot035_0}

graph <- ggplot(mpg) 

graph

```

```{r ggplot035}

graph <- ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) 

graph

```


## Geometries

We see that it represents a sort of canvas where the variables to be represented are displayed. We need a geometry *layer*. Yo can see a list of ggplot2 geometries [here](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/#geoms)

```{r ggplot04}

graph <- ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point()

graph

```

Within aesthetics, we can incorporate additional options:

* `color`: Specifies the color of the geometry and can vary depending on a third variable if such a dependency exists

* `fill` Specifies the fill color of the geometry if it's a shape that can be filled (such as bars, points, polygons, etc.).

* `shape` Indicates the shape of the points (ordered pairs or n-tuples of the represented variables) or the lines connecting them.

* `size` Defines the size of the geometry.

* `alpha` Controls the transparency of the geometry.

We add a color to the geometry that depends on the discrete variable `class` from the dataset.

```{r ggplot05}

graph <- ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class)) +
  geom_point()

graph

```

This is what we called a a _non fixed_ aesthetic, in this case it should appear as a argument if the `aes()` function.

Look at what happens if we include the color argument in `geom_point()`

```{r ggplot055}
#| eval: false

graph <- ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point(color = class)

graph

```

We obtain a error, let us substitute the `class` variable by a color name

```{r ggplot056}

graph <- ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point(color = "blue")

graph

```

This is what we call a _fixed aesthetic_, the color is the same for all the points.

Likewise, we can include a shape for each ordered pair that depends on another variable, in this case `cyl`. Before adding it, we convert it into a factor

```{r ggplot06}

graph <- ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ,
                         y = hwy,
                         color = class,
                         shape = factor(cyl))
                ) +
  geom_point()

graph

```

We can modify the size of the aesthetics

```{r ggplot065}

graph <- ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class, shape = factor(cyl))) +
  geom_point(size = 3)

graph

```

Honestly, this chart introduces more confusion than it resolves. Let’s simplify our approach by returning to the basic version, and we will select the shape of the aesthetic elements using the `shape` attribute. Each shape option is assigned a specific number, which you can reference [here](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/articles/ggplot2-specs.html#point)

```{r ggplot07}

graph <- ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = factor(cyl))) +
  geom_point(size = 3, shape = 23)

graph

```

Let's stick with slightly larger circles

```{r ggplot08}

graph <- ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = factor(cyl))) +
  geom_point(size = 4, shape = 21)

graph

```

We are going to exclude cars with 5 cylinders (as there are very few), and this way we see how we can manipulate the dataset within the plot instructions.

```{r ggplot09}
#| class-source: "numberLines"
#| source-line-numbers: "1"

graph <- ggplot(mpg |> dplyr::filter(cyl != 5),
                  aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = factor(cyl))) +
  geom_point(size = 4, shape = 21)

graph

```

Changing the geom, bar graph

```{r ggplot092}
#| class-source: "numberLines"
#| source-line-numbers: "1"

graph <- ggplot(mpg, aes(x = cyl, fill = factor(class))) +
  geom_bar()

graph

```

```{r ggplot0925}
#| class-source: "numberLines"
#| source-line-numbers: "1"

graph <- ggplot(mpg, aes(x = cyl, fill = factor(class))) +
  geom_bar() +
  coord_flip()

graph

```

```{r ggplot0926}
#| class-source: "numberLines"
#| source-line-numbers: "1"

graph <- ggplot(mpg, aes(x = cyl, fill = factor(class))) +
  geom_bar(position = "dodge")

graph

```

```{r ggplot0927}
#| class-source: "numberLines"
#| source-line-numbers: "1"

graph <- ggplot(mpg, aes(x = class, fill = factor(cyl))) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill") +
  labs(y = "Proportion")

graph

```

We will explore a different dataset that is well-suited for creating line graphs, the `economics` dataset

```{r ggplotecon}

economics


```

Line graph

```{r ggplot082}

graph <- ggplot(economics, aes(x = date, y = unemploy)) +
  geom_line()

graph

```

```{r ggplot083}

graph <- ggplot(economics, aes(x = date, y = unemploy)) +
  geom_line(color = "blue", size = 1.2)

graph

```

Histograms

```{r ggplot14}
#| warning: false

graph_h <- ggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty)) +
  geom_histogram()

graph_h

```

Not that nice, let us change the default parameters, the bindwith

```{r ggplot15}
#| warning: false

graph_h <- ggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 3)

graph_h

```

Or the number of bins

```{r ggplot152}
#| warning: false

graph_h <- ggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 8)

graph_h

```

Or use some colors

```{r ggplot16}
#| warning: false

graph_h <- ggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 3, fill = "blue", color = "black")

graph_h

```


A boxplot

```{r ggplot17}
#| warning: false

graph_b <- ggplot(mpg, aes(x =factor(class), y = hwy)) +
  geom_boxplot()

graph_b

```

Change the color

```{r ggplot172}
#| warning: false

graph_b <- ggplot(mpg, aes(x =factor(class), y = hwy)) +
  geom_boxplot(color= "black", fill = "cornsilk")

graph_b

```

```{r ggplot173}
#| warning: false

graph_b <- ggplot(mpg, aes(x =factor(class), y = hwy, fill = factor(class) )) +
  geom_boxplot()

graph_b

```

We can also compare distributions using densities

```{r ggpplot174}

ggplot(mpg |> dplyr::filter(cyl != 5),
       aes(x = hwy, fill = factor(cyl))
       ) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.4) 

```

Another way of representing densities using a _joyplot_ with the library `ggridges`

```{r ggpplot175}

library(ggridges)

ggplot(mpg, 
       aes(x = hwy, y = class, fill = class)) +
  geom_density_ridges() + 
  theme_ridges()

```


## Facets

It may not be easy to view everything on a single graph, in this case we can create a sub plot for each categorical variable. In such cases, we can define facets with `facet_wrap()`.

```{r ggplot12}
#| warning: false

graph <- ggplot(mpg |> dplyr::filter(cyl != 5),
                  aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = factor(cyl))) +
  geom_point(size = 4, shape = 21) +
  facet_wrap( ~ cyl)

graph

```

You can also facet by two categorical variables using `facet_grid()`

```{r ggplot13}
#| warning: false

graph <- ggplot(mpg |> dplyr::filter(cyl != 5),
                  aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = factor(manufacturer))) +
  geom_point(size = 4, shape = 21) +
  facet_grid(class ~ cyl)

graph

```

```{r ggplot17f}
#| warning: false

graph_b <- ggplot(mpg, aes(x =factor(class), y = hwy)) +
  geom_boxplot(color= "black", fill = "cornsilk")+
  facet_wrap(~year)

graph_b

```

## Statistics

Now, let’s estimate a linear relationship between the variables `hwy` and `disp` by cylinders.

```{r ggplot10}
#| warning: false

graph <- ggplot(mpg |> dplyr::filter(cyl != 5),
                  aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = factor(cyl))) +
  geom_point(size = 4, shape = 21) +
  geom_smooth(method = lm)

graph

```

We have the ability to adjust the appearance of the smoothing functions. For instance, we can remove the confidence interval and change the line thickness.

```{r ggplot105}
#| warning: false

graph <- ggplot(mpg |> dplyr::filter(cyl != 5),
                  aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = factor(cyl))) +
  geom_point(size = 4, shape = 21) +
  geom_smooth(method = lm, se = FALSE, size = 3)

graph

```

And if we want the relationship to be nonlinear, we do not specify the method (nonlinear is the default)

```{r ggplot11}
#| warning: false

graph <- ggplot(mpg |> dplyr::filter(cyl != 5),
                  aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = factor(cyl))) +
  geom_point(size = 4, shape = 21) +
  geom_smooth()

graph

```

A simpler non-linear version

```{r ggplot18}

graph <- ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point(colour = "blue", size = 2) +  
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = y ~ poly(x, 2), color = "red")

graph 

```
